# budget-visualization
A simple visualizer for simple budgeting and money discussions.

Goals:
* Work with multiple accounts.
* Enable flat and percentage based monthly account adjustments.
* Work for non-programmers. (The v1 python script didn't.)
* Be shareable.

# Getting started

  npm install
  npm start

Head to localhost:3000 and witness the magic.
